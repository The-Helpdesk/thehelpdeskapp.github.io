Every day millions, if not billions of people power on their devices, relying on them to help them communicate and perform up to expectations. But these devices are extremely complicated. Software developers spend years creating complex software for these devices, but technology isn't perfect. Lots of things go wrong with devices and these problems can happen to anyone at any time. What's the solution?  The internet. Well anyone can post on the internet, and that presents problems to consumers looking for support. Software is updated frequently....but the internet doesn't delete outdated articles. That's where the Helpdesk comes in. The Helpdesk is an easy way to get technical help, without all the outdated information and confusion.

       <!--Question 1 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-1">What's the goal?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-1">Our goal at the Helpdesk is to provide a way to get technology help without phone calls, chat help, & community forums. We assemble a collection of the highest quality articles from the web and also write our own articles to provide a large library of help that is up to date and easy to understand. When we see new software updates, we update our articles to match the new software, and create an archive for legacy articles.</p>
       <!--Question 2 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-2">When can I get the app?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-2">The app will have versions for all major platforms eventually. In early 2021 we will launch a web app. In late 2021 we will role out our App Store version for iOS/iPadOS. In 2022 we will release a macOS and Windows version. Finally, in early 2023, we will add an Android version. More details about launch dates will come out closer to time.</p>
       <!--Question 3 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-3">How much does it cost?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-3">The app will be free with no ads to start, but could eventually move on to a low price. However, the web version will always be free and we will never have ads.</p>
       <!--Question 4 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-4">Can I enroll for beta testing?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-4">Yes, we will begin beta testing next spring or summer for iOS and iPadOS.
