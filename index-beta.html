The Helpdesk is an app that allows you to get access to updated, current, and verified technology help, tips, and resources. The solutions in our articles undergo rigorous testing to make sure they work the best and are user intuitive. We stepped into the user's shoes and realized they don't need another login, hard-to-navigate website, or set of complicated instructions. These were the founding principles when we started developing The Helpdesk and we took all of that away when we started building the Helpdesk to provide the best user experience.

<b id="sub-header">Why did we create The Helpdesk?</b>
<div id="intro-txt">We started The Helpdesk because we saw a problem in the world: there's no easy way to get technology help. Sure, there are different support sites and apps from companies, but these apps and websites are a second thought that not as much effort goes in too. Most of the time, this leads to a clunky, slow experience that doesn't work for the end-user. There are also lots of community forums to help people; however, these forums get outdated quickly. </div>

    <div id="faq-header-txt"><b>FAQs</b></div>
       <!--Question 1 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-1">What's the goal?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-1">Our goal at the Helpdesk is to provide a way to get technology help without phone calls, chat help, & community forums. We assemble a collection of the highest quality articles from the web and also write our own articles to provide a large library of help that is up to date and easy to understand. When we see new software updates we update our articles to match the new software, and create an archive for legacy articles.</p>
       <!--Question 2 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-2">When can I get the app?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-2">The app will have versions for all major platforms eventually. In early 2021 we will launch a web app. In late 2021 we will role out our App Store version for iOS/iPadOS. In 2022 we will release a macOS and Windows version. Finally, in early 2023, we will add an Android version. More details about launch dates will come out closer to time.</p>
       <!--Question 3 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-3">How much does it cost?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-3">The app will be free with no ads to start, but could eventually move on to a low price. However, the web version will always be free and we will never have ads.</p>
       <!--Question 4 -->
    <b class="question-header" id="question-header-4">Can I enroll for beta testing?</b>
    <p class="question-txt" id="question-txt-4">Yes, we will begin beta testing next spring or summer for iOS and iPadOS. You can be notified about beta testing by signing up through <a class="link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3gOfgFM61GNPS-cxosyCwL19dV8tLXyHqBTUKW2cC_YP_dw/viewform?usp=sf_link">this link.</a></p>
       <!--Question 5 -->
